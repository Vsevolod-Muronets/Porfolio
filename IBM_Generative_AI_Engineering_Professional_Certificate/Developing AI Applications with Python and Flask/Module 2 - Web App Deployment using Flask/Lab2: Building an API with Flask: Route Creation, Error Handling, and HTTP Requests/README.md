# Hands-on Lab: Building an API with Flask: Route Creation, Error Handling, and HTTP Requests

##

**Estimated time needed:** 45 minutes

##

Welcome to part 2 of Flask lab. You will work with routes and HTTP requests in this lab. You will practice creating a small RESTful API. Finally, you will work with application level error handlers for common errors like:
- 404 NOT FOUND
- 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR

You should know all the concepts you require for this lab from the previous set of videos. Feel free to pause the lab and review the module if you are unclear on how to perform a task or need more information.


## Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Write routes to process requests to the Flask server at specific URLs
- Handle parameters and arguments sent to the URLs
- Write error handlers for server and user errors

::page{title="About Skills Network Cloud IDE"}

Skills Network Cloud IDE (based on Theia and Docker) provides an environment for hands on labs for course and project related labs. Theia is an open source IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on desktop or the cloud. To complete this lab, you will use the Cloud IDE based on Theia and MongoDB running in a Docker container.

## Important Notice about this lab environment

Please be aware that sessions do not persist for this lab environment. Every time you connect to this lab, a new environment is created for you. Any data saved in earlier sessions will be lost. Plan to complete these labs in a single session to avoid losing your data.

---

::page{title="Set Up the Lab Environment"}

There are some required prerequisite preparations before you start the lab.

## Open a Terminal

Open a terminal window using the menu in the editor: **Terminal** > **New Terminal**.

In the terminal, if you are not in the `/home/project` folder, change to your project folder now.

```bash
cd /home/project
```

## Create the lab directory

You should have a lab directory from Part 1 of the lab. If you do not have the directory, create it now.

```bash
mkdir lab
```

Change to the `lab` directory:

```bash
cd lab
```

You created a `server.py` file in the lab directory in Part 1 of the lab. Create the file if it is not present and add the following starting code snippet to it.

```
# Import the Flask class from the flask module
from flask import Flask

# Create an instance of the Flask class, passing in the name of the current module
app = Flask(__name__)

# Define a route for the root URL ("/")
@app.route("/")
def index():
    # Function that handles requests to the root URL
    # Return a plain text response
    return "hello world"
```
> **Note:** Ensure that all code uses 4-space indentation to avoid `IndentationError`.

Recall that the above code creates a Flask server and adds a home endpoint "/" that returns the string **hello world**. You will now add more code to this file in this lab.

As a recap, use the following command to run the server from the terminal:
```bash
flask --app server --debug run
```

![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-CD0320EN-SkillsNetwork/images/m1-flask-run-app.png "Run Flask server in debug mode")

> **Note:** If port `5000` is in use, try a different port like `5001`. If the server fails to start, check `server.py` for syntax errors or missing imports.


You should now use the CURL command with `localhost:5000/`. Note that the terminal is running the server. You can use the `Split Terminal` button to split the terminal and run the following command in the second tab.

```bash
curl -X GET -i -w '\n' localhost:5000
```

### Optional

If working in the terminal becomes difficult because the command prompt is long, you can shorten the prompt using the following command:

```bash
export PS1="[\[\033[01;32m\]\u\[\033[00m\]: \[\033[01;34m\]\W\[\033[00m\]]\$ "
```

::page{title="Step 1: Set response status code"}

In the last part, you saw Flask automatically sends an `HTTP 200 OK` successful response when you sent back a message. However, you can also set the return status explicitly. Recall that there are two ways to do this, as discussed in the video:
1. Send a tuple back with the message
2. Use the **make_response()** method to create a custom response and set the status

### Your Tasks

1. Send custom HTTP code back with a tuple.

	You will reuse the `server.py` file you worked on in the last part. Create a new method named `no_content` with the `@app.route` decorator and URL of `/no_content`. The method does not have any arguments. Return a tuple with the JSON message `No content found`.

<details>
	<summary>Click here for a hint.</summary>

> You can use the following skeleton code as a start:

```python
{insert @app decorator}
def {insert method name}():
    """return 'No content found' with a status of 204

    Returns:
        string: No content found
	    status code: 204
    """
    return ({insert dictionary here}, {insert HTTP code here})
```
</details>

You can test the endpoint with the following CURL command:
```bash
curl -X GET -i -w '\n' localhost:5000/no_content
```

You should see an output similar to the following. Note the status of `204` and the Content-Type of `application/json`. Note that even though you returned a JSON message, it is not sent back to the client as `204`. By default, nothing is returned.

```
HTTP/1.1 204 NO CONTENT
Server: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.7.16
Date: Wed, 28 Dec 2022 19:49:18 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: close
```
### Why Use 204?
The 204 No Content status is used in REST APIs when a request succeeds but no data needs to be returned. For example:
- After deleting a resource (e.g., a user), the server confirms success without sending the deleted data.
- When confirming an action (e.g., updating settings) without additional information.
- Here we are returning a JSON message.But because we are telling the client via the status code 204 that no content will be returned, most HTTP clients will ignore the body.If you need to show a message ,use status code 200

2. Send custom HTTP code back with the `make_response()` method.The `make_response()` method in Flask is used to create a full HTTP response object manually, giving you more control over the response than just returning a value or a tuple.

	Create a second method named `index_explicit` with the `@app.route` decorator and a URL of `/exp`. The method does not have any arguments. Use the `make_response()` method to create a new response. Set the status to 200.


<details>
	<summary>Click here for a hint.</summary>

> Import the Flask class from the flask module
> Import the make_response method from the flask module.

```python
{insert @app decorator}
def {insert method name here}:
    """return 'Hello World' message with a status code of 200

    Returns:
        string: Hello World
        status code: 200
    """
    resp = make_response({insert ditionary here})
    resp.status_code = {insert status code here}
    return resp
```
</details>

You can test the endpoint with the following CURL command:
```bash
curl -X GET -i -w '\n' localhost:5000/exp
```

You should see an output similar to the one given below. Note the status of `200`, Content-Type of `application/json`, and JSON output of `{"message": "Hello World"}`:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.7.16
Date: Wed, 28 Dec 2022 19:55:46 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 31
Connection: close

{
  "message": "Hello World"
}
```

::page{title="Step 2: Process input arguments"}

It is common for clients to pass arguments in the URL. You will learn how to process arguments in this lab. The lab provides a list of people with their id, first name, last name, and address information in an object. Normally, this information is stored in a database, but you are using a hard coded list for your simple use case. This data was generated with [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/ "Mockaroo").

The client will send in requests in the form of `http://localhost:5000?q=first_name`. You will create a method that will accept a first_name as the input and return a person with that first name.

<details>

```
</details>

Let\'s confirm that the data has been copied to the file. Copy the following code into the **server.py** file to create an end point that returns the person's data to the client in JSON format.

```
@app.route("/data")
def get_data():
    try:
        # Check if 'data' exists and has a length greater than 0
        if data and len(data) > 0:
            # Return a JSON response with a message indicating the length of the data
            return {"message": f"Data of length {len(data)} found"}
        else:
            # If 'data' is empty, return a JSON response with a 500 Internal Server Error status code
            return {"message": "Data is empty"}, 500
    except NameError:
        # Handle the case where 'data' is not defined
        # Return a JSON response with a 404 Not Found status code
        return {"message": "Data not found"}, 404

```

The above code simply checks if the variable `data` exits. If it does not, the `NameError` is raised and an `HTTP 404` is returned. If data exists and is empty, an `HTTP 500` is returned. If data exists and is not empty, an `HTTP 200` success message is returned.

Run a CURL command to confirm you get the success message back:

```bash
curl -X GET -i -w '\n' localhost:5000/data
```

Expected result:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.7.16
Date: Wed, 28 Dec 2022 20:51:56 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 42
Connection: close

{
  "message": "Data of length 5 found"
}
```


### Your Tasks

Create a method called `name_search` with the `@app.route` decorator. This method should be called when a client requests for the `/name_search` URL. The method will not accept any parameter, however, will look for the argument `q` in the incoming request URL. This argument holds the first_name the client is looking for. The method returns:
   - Person information with a status of `HTTP 200` if the first_name is found in the data
   - Message of `Invalid input parameter` with a status of `HTTP 400` if the argument `q` is missing from the request
   - Message of `Person not found` with a status code of `HTTP 404` if the person is not found in the data

### Hint
Ensure you import the `request` module from Flask. You will use this to get the first name from the HTTP request.

```
from flask import request
```

You can use the following code as your starting point:
<details>
	<summary>Click here for a hint.</summary>

```python
@app.route("/name_search")
def name_search():
    """Find a person in the database.

    Returns:
        json: Person if found, with status of 200
        404: If not found
        400: If argument 'q' is missing
        422: If argument 'q' is present but invalid
    """
    # Get the argument 'q' from the query parameters of the request
    query = request.args.get('q')

    # Check if the query parameter 'q' is missing
    if query is None:
        return {"message": "Query parameter 'q' is missing"}, 400

    # Check if the query parameter is present but invalid (e.g., empty or numeric)
    if query.strip() == "" or query.isdigit():
        return {"message": "Invalid input parameter"}, 422

    # Iterate through the 'data' list to look for the person whose first name matches the query
    for person in data:
        if query.lower() in person["first_name"].lower():
            # If a match is found, return the person as a JSON response with a 200 OK status code
            return person, 200

    # If no match is found, return a JSON response with a message indicating the person was not found and a 404 Not Found status code
    return {"message": "Person not found"}, 404

```
</details>

You can test the endpoint with the following CURL command. Ensure that the server is running in the terminal as in the previous steps.
```bash
curl -X GET -i -w '\n' "localhost:5000/name_search?q=Abdel"
```

You should see an output similar to the one given below. Note the status of `200`, Content-Type of `application/json`, and JSON output of person with first name **Abdel**:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.7.16
Date: Wed, 28 Dec 2022 21:14:31 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 295
Connection: close

{
  "address": "2 Lake View Point",
  "avatar": "http://dummyimage.com/145x100.png/dddddd/000000",
  "city": "Shreveport",

  "first_name": "Abdel",
  "graduation_year": 1995,
  "id": "0dd63e57-0b5f-44bc-94ae-5c1b4947cb49",
  "last_name": "Duke",
  "zip": "71105"
}
```

Next, test that the method returns `HTTP 422` if the argument `q` is invalid:
```bash
curl -X GET -i -w '\n' "localhost:5000/name_search?q=123"
```
or

```bash
curl -X GET -i -w '\n' "localhost:5000/name_search?q="
```
> **Note:** Use `HTTP 400` (Bad Request) when the required query parameter is missing. Use `HTTP 422` (Unprocessable Entity) only if the parameter is present but has invalid or unacceptable content.


You should see an output similar to the one given below. Note the status of `422`, Content-Type of `application/json`, and JSON output of `Invalid input parameter`:

```
HTTP/1.1 422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY
Server: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.7.16
Date: Wed, 28 Dec 2022 21:16:07 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 43
Connection: close

{
  "message": "Invalid input parameter"
}
```
Finally, let\'s test the case where the first_name is not present in our list of people:
```bash
curl -X GET -i -w '\n' "localhost:5000/name_search?q=qwerty"
```
You should see an output similar to the one given below. Note the status of `404`, Content-Type of `application/json`, and JSON output of `Person not found`:
```
HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND
Server: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.7.16
Date: Wed, 28 Dec 2022 21:17:28 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 36
Connection: close

{
  "message": "Person not found"
}
```

::page{title="Step 3: Add dynamic URLs"}

An important part of back-end programming is creating APIs. An API is a contract between a provider and a user. It is common to create RESTful APIs that can be called by the front end or other clients. In a REST based API, the resource information is sent as part of the request URL. For example, with your resource or persons, the client can send the following request:
```
GET http://localhost/person/unique_identifier
```
This request asks for a person with a unique identifier. Another example is:
```
DELETE http://localhost/person/unique_identifier
```
In this case, the client asks to delete the person with this unique identifier.


## Your Tasks

You are asked to implement both of these endpoints in this exercise. You will also implement a `count` method that returns the total number of persons in the `data` list. This will help confirm that the two methods GET and DELETE work, as required.

### Task 1: Create GET /count endpoint

1. Create **/count** endpoint.

	Add the `@app.get()` decorator for the `/count` URL. Define the count function that simply returns the number of items in the `data` list.

	<details>
		<summary>Click here for a hint.</summary>

	> Use the **len()** method to return the number of items in the **data** list.

	```
	@app.route("/count")
	def count():
		try:
			# Attempt to return a JSON response with the count of items in 'data'
			# Replace {insert code to find length of data} with len(data) to get the length of the 'data' collection
			return {"data count": len(data)}, 200
		except NameError:
			# If 'data' is not defined and raises a NameError
			# Return a JSON response with a message and a 500 Internal Server Error status code
			return {"message": "data not defined"}, 500

	```
	</details>

	Test the **count** method by calling the endpoint.
	```bash
	curl -X GET -i -w '\n' "localhost:5000/count"
	```

	You should see an ouput with the number of items in the data list.
	```
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Server: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.7.16
	Date: Sat, 31 Dec 2022 22:41:35 GMT
	Content-Type: application/json
	Content-Length: 22
	Connection: close

	{
	  "data count": 5
	}
	```

### Task 2: Create GET /person/id endpoint

1. Implement the **GET** endpoint to ask for a person by id.

	Create a new endpoint for `http://localhost/person/unique_identifier`. The method should be named `find_by_uuid`. It should take an argument of type UUID and return the person JSON if found. If the person is not found, the method should return a 404 with a message of **person not found**. Finally, the client (curl) should only be able to call this method by passing a valid UUID type id.

	<details>
		<summary>Click here for a hint.</summary>

	> - use the type:name syntax to only allow callers to pass in a valid UUID.
	> - comparing uuid with string returns False. Make sure you convert UUID into str when comparing with the id attribute of the person.

	```bash
	@app.route("/person/<var_name>")
	def find_by_uuid(var_name):
		# Iterate through the 'data' list to search for a person with a matching ID
		for person in data:
			# Check if the 'id' field of the person matches the 'var_name' parameter
			if person["id"] == str(var_name):
				# Return the person as a JSON response if a match is found
				return person

		# Return a JSON response with a message and a 404 Not Found status code if no matching person is found
		return {"message": "Person not found"}, 404
	```
	</details>

	Test the **/person/uuid** URL by calling the endpoint.
	```bash
	curl -X GET -i localhost:5000/person/66c09925-589a-43b6-9a5d-d1601cf53287
	```

	You should see an ouput with the person and HTTP code of 200.
	```
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Server: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.7.16
	Date: Sat, 31 Dec 2022 22:48:32 GMT
	Content-Type: application/json
	Content-Length: 294
	Connection: close

	{
	  "address": "637 Carey Pass",
	  "avatar": "http://dummyimage.com/174x100.png/ff4444/ffffff",
	  "city": "Gainesville",
	  "country": "United States",
	  "first_name": "Lilla",
	  "graduation_year": 1985,
	  "id": "66c09925-589a-43b6-9a5d-d1601cf53287",
	  "last_name": "Aupol",
	  "zip": "32627"
	}
	```

	If you pass in an invalid UUID, the server should return a 404 message.
	```bash
	curl -X GET -i localhost:5000/person/not-a-valid-uuid
	```

	You should see an error in the output with a code of 404. Flask automatically returns HTML, you will change the HTML in the next part of the lab to return JSON by default on all errors, including 404.
	```
	HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND

	<h1>Not Found</h1>
	<p>The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually, please check your spelling and try again.</p>
	```

	Finally, pass in a valid UUID that does not exist in the data list. The method should return a 404 with a message of **person not found**.

	```bash
	curl -X GET -i localhost:5000/person/11111111-589a-43b6-9a5d-d1601cf51111
	```
	You should see a JSON response with an HTTP code of 404 and a message of **person not found**.

### Task 3: Create DELETE /person/id endpoint

1. Implement the **DELETE** endpoint to delete a person resource.

	Create a new endpoint for DELETE `http://localhost/person/unique_identifier`. The method should be named `delete_by_uuid`. It should take in an argument of type UUID and delete the person from the **data** list with that id. If the person is not found, the method should return a 404 with a message of **person not found**. Finally, the client (curl) should call this method by passing a valid UUID type id.

	<details>
		<summary>Click here for a hint.</summary>

	> - use the type:name syntax to only allow callers to pass in a valid UUID.
	> - comparing uuid with string returns False. Make sure you convert UUID into str when comparing with the id attribute of the person.
	> - pass the **DELETE** method tpye as the second argument to @app decorator or use the @app.delete() decorator.

	```bash
	@app.route("/person/<uuid:id>", methods=['DELETE'])
	def delete_person(var_name):
		for person in data:
			if person["id"] == str(var_name):
				# Remove the person from the data list
				data.remove(person)
				# Return a JSON response with a message and HTTP status code 200 (OK)
				return {"message": "Person with ID deleted"}, 200
		# If no person with the given ID is found, return a JSON response with a message and HTTP status code 404 (Not Found)
		return {"message": "Person not found"}, 404
	```
	</details>

	Test the DELETE **/person/uuid** URL by calling the endpoint.
	```bash
	curl -X DELETE -i localhost:5000/person/66c09925-589a-43b6-9a5d-d1601cf53287
	```

	You should see an ouput with the id of the person deleted and a status code of 200.
	```
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Server: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.7.16
	Date: Sat, 31 Dec 2022 23:00:17 GMT
	Content-Type: application/json
	Content-Length: 56
	Connection: close

	{
	  "message": "Person with ID 66c09925-589a-43b6-9a5d-d1601cf53287 deleted"
	}
	```

	You can now use the **count** endpoint you added earlier to test if the number of persons has reduced by one.

	```bash
	curl -X GET -i localhost:5000/count
	```

	You should see the count returned reduced by one.

	```
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Server: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.7.16
	Date: Sat, 31 Dec 2022 23:06:55 GMT
	Content-Type: application/json
	Content-Length: 22
	Connection: close

	{
	  "data count": 4
	}
	```

	If you pass an invalid UUID, the server should return a 404 message.
	```bash
	curl -X DELETE -i localhost:5000/person/not-a-valid-uuid
	```

	You should see an error in the output with a code of 404. Flask automatically returns HTML, and we will change the HTML in the next part of the lab to return JSON by default on all errors, including 404.
	```
	HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND

	<title>404 Not Found</title>
	<h1>Not Found</h1>
	<p>The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>
	```

	Finally, pass in a valid UUID that does not exist in the data list. The method should return a 404 with a message of **person not found**.

	```bash
	curl -X DELETE -i localhost:5000/person/11111111-589a-43b6-9a5d-d1601cf51111
	```
	You should see a JSON response with an HTTP code of 404 and a message of **person not found**.

::page{title="Step 4: Parse JSON from Request body"}

Let\'s create another RESTful API. The client can send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:5000/person` with the person detail JSON as the body. The server should parse the request for the body and then create a new person with that detail. In your case, to create the person, simply add to the `data` list.

### Your Tasks

Create a method called `add_by_uuid` with the `@app.route` decorator. This method should be called when a client requests with the `POST` method for the `/person` URL. The method will not accept any parameter but will grab the person details from the JSON body of the POST request. The method returns:
- The person's `id` with an HTTP 200 status code if the person is successfully added to the `data` list.
- A message `"Invalid input parameter"` with an HTTP 422 status code if the JSON body is missing or empty.


### Hint
Ensure you import the `request` module from Flask. You will use this to get the first name from the HTTP request.

```
from flask import request
```

You can use the following code as your starting point. In production code, you will put in some logic to validate the JSON coming in. You would not want to store any random data coming from a client. You can omit this validation for your simple use case.
<details>
	<summary>Click here for a hint.</summary>

```python
@app.route("/person", methods=['POST'])
def create_person():
    # Get the JSON data from the incoming request
    new_person = request.get_json()

    # Check if the JSON data is empty or None
    if not new_person:
        # Return a JSON response indicating that the request data is invalid
        # with a status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity)
        return {"message": "Invalid input, no data provided"}, 422

    # Proceed with further processing of 'new_person', such as adding it to a database
    # or validating its contents before saving it

    # Assuming the processing is successful, return a success message with status code 200 (Created)
    return {"message": "Person created successfully"}, 200
```
</details>

You can test the endpoint with the following CURL command. Ensure that the server is running in the terminal as in the previous steps.

```bash
curl -X POST -i -w '\n' \
  --url http://localhost:5000/person \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
        "id": "4e1e61b4-8a27-11ed-a1eb-0242ac120002",
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Horne",
        "graduation_year": 2001,
        "address": "1 hill drive",
        "city": "Atlanta",
        "zip": "30339",
        "country": "United States",
        "avatar": "http://dummyimage.com/139x100.png/cc0000/ffffff"
}'
```

You should see an output similar to the one given below. Note the status of `200`, Content-Type of `application/json`, and JSON output of person with the first name **Abdel**:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.7.16
Date: Sun, 01 Jan 2023 23:14:34 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 56
Connection: close

{
  "message": "4e1e61b4-8a27-11ed-a1eb-0242ac120002"
}
```

You can also test the case where you send an empty JSON to the enpoint by using the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST -i -w '\n' \
  --url http://localhost:5000/person \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{}'
```

The server should return a code of 422 with a message of `Invalid input parameter`.
```
HTTP/1.1 422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY
Server: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.7.16
Date: Sun, 01 Jan 2023 23:15:54 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 43
Connection: close

{
  "message": "Invalid input parameter"
}
```
### Solution
Double-check that your work matches the following solution. There is more than one way to implement this solution. Note that you also check if the list `data` exists in the solution and returns a 500 if it does not.

    # code to validate new_person ommited
    try:
        data.append(new_person)
    except NameError:
        return {"message": "data not defined"}, 500

    return {"message": f"{new_person['id']}"}, 200

::page{title="Step 5: Add error handlers"}

In this final part of the lab, you will add application level global handlers to handle errors like 404 (not found) and 500 (internal server error). Recall from the video that Flask makes it easy to handle these global error handlers using the errorhandler() decorator.

If you make an invalid request to the server now, Flask will return an HTML page with the 404 error. Something like this:

Command:
```bash
curl -X POST -i -w '\n' http://localhost:5000/notvalid
```
Response:
```
HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND
Server: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.7.16
Date: Sun, 01 Jan 2023 23:21:54 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 207
Connection: close

<!doctype html>
<html lang=en>
<title>404 Not Found</title>
<h1>Not Found</h1>
<p>The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually, please check your spelling and try again.</p>
```
This is great, but you want to return a JSON response for all invalid requests.

### Your Tasks

Create a method called `api_not_found` with the `@app.errorhandler` decorator. This method will return a message of `API not found` with an HTTP status code of `404` whenever the client requests a URL that does not lead to any endpoints defined by the server.


### Hint
Use the `@app.errorhandler` decorator and pass in the HTTP code of `404`.

You can use the following code as your starting point:
<details>
	<summary>Click here for a hint.</summary>

```python
{insert errorhandler decorator here}({insert error code here})
def {insert method name here}(error):
    return {"message": "{insert error message here}"}, {insert error code here}
```
</details>

You can test the endpoint with the following CURL command. Ensure that the server is running in the terminal, as in the previous steps.
```bash
curl -X POST -i -w '\n' http://localhost:5000/notvalid
```

You should see an output similar to the one below. Note the status of `404`, Content-Type of `application/json`, and JSON output message of **API not found**:
```
HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND
Server: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.7.16
Date: Sun, 01 Jan 2023 23:25:35 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 33
Connection: close

{
  "message": "API not found"
}
```

Note that the server no longer returns HTML but JSON as required.


### Solution
Double-check that your work matches the solution below. There is more than one way to implement this solution.
<details>
	<summary>Click here for the answer.</summary>

```python
@app.errorhandler(404)
def api_not_found(error):
    # This function is a custom error handler for 404 Not Found errors
    # It is triggered whenever a 404 error occurs within the Flask application
    return {"message": "API not found"}, 404
```
</details>

Similarly you can add a global Error Handler for `500 (internal server error) ` also.

You can register a global error handler in Flask for any unhandled exceptions by using:

```bash
@app.errorhandler(Exception)
def handle_exception(e):
    return {"message": str(e)}, 500
```
This tells Flask to catch any unhandled Exception raised anywhere in your app and route it to this handler, returning a 500 Internal Server Error response with the error message.
	
You can deliberately raise an exception to test the global handler. Add the following route before your error handlers:
```bash
@app.route("/test500")
def test500():
    raise Exception("Forced exception for testing")

```
Then run this curl command in your terminal:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/test500

```
You should see a response like:
```bash
{
  "message": "Forced exception for testing"
}

```
